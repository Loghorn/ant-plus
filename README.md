# ant-plus

A node.js module for ANT+

## Prerequisites

Libusb is included as a submodule. On Linux, you'll need libudev to build libusb. On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install build-essential libudev-dev`

### Windows
Use [Zadig](http://sourceforge.net/projects/libwdi/files/zadig/) to install the WinUSB driver for your USB device. Otherwise you will get `LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` when attempting to open devices.

## Install

```sh
npm install ant-plus
```

## usage

```javascript
var Ant = require('ant-plus');
```
#### Create USB stick

```javascript
var stick = new Ant.GarminStick3;
```

#### Create sensors

```javascript
var sensor = new Ant.HeartRateSensor(stick);
```

#### Attach events

```javascript
sensor.on('hbdata', function (data) {
	console.log(data.DeviceID, data.ComputedHeartRate);
});

stick.on('startup', function () {
	sensor.attach(0, 0);
});
```

#### Open stick

```javascript
if (!stick.open()) {
	console.log('Stick not found!');
}
```

### scanning
```javascript
sensor.on('hbdata', function (data) {
	console.log(data.DeviceID, data.ComputedHeartRate);
});

stick.on('startup', function () {
	sensor.scan();
);

if (!stick.open()) {
	console.log('Stick not found!');
}
```

## Important notes

* never attach a sensor before receiveing the startup event
* never attach a new sensor before receiving the attached or detached event of the previous sensor
* never detach a sensor before receiving the attached or detached event of the previous sensor

## Objects

### GarminStick2 and GarminStick3

#### properties

##### maxChannels

The maximum number of channels that this stick supports; valid only after startup event fired.

#### methods

##### is_present()

Checks if the stick is present. Returns true if it is, false otherwise.

##### open()

Tries to open the stick. Returns false on failure.

##### close()

Closes the stick.

#### events

##### startup

Fired after the stick is correctly initialized.

##### shutdown

Fired after the stick is correctly closed.

### HeartRateSensor

#### methods

##### attach(channel, deviceId)

Attaches the sensors, using the specified channel and deviceId (use 0 to connect to the first device found).

##### detach()

Detaches the sensor.

#### events

##### attached

Fired after the sensor is correctly attached.

##### detached

Fired after the sensor is correctly detached.

##### hbdata

Fired when new heartbeat data is received.

### HeartRateScanner

##### scan()

Attaches the sensors and starts scanning for data from every devices in range.

##### detach()

Detaches the sensor.

#### events

##### attached

Fired after the sensor is correctly attached.

##### detached

Fired after the sensor is correctly detached.

##### hbdata

Fired when new heartbeat data is received.

### SpeedCadenceSensor

##### attach(channel, deviceId)

Attaches the sensor, using the specified channel and deviceId (use 0 to connect to the first device found).

##### detach()

Detaches the sensor.

#### setWheelCircumference(circumferenceInMeters)

Calibrates the speed sensor. Defaults to an ~ 700c wheel, 2.118

#### events

##### attached

Fired after the sensor is correctly attached.

##### detached

Fired after the sensor is correctly detached.

##### speedData

Fired when a new wheel speed is calculated

##### cadenceData

Fired when a new pedal cadence is calculated

### StrideSpeedDistanceSensor
### StrideSpeedDistanceScanner

### PowerSensor

##### attach(channel, deviceId)

Attaches the sensor, using the specified channel and deviceId (use 0 to connect to the first device found).

##### set_offset(offset)

Sets the offset of the PowerMeter.

#### events

##### cadenceData

Fired when new cadence has been calculated.

##### torqueData

Fired when new torque has been calculated.

##### powerData

Fired when new power has been calculated.
