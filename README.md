# ant-plus

A node.js module for ANT+

## Prerequisites

Libusb is included as a submodule. On Linux, you'll need libudev to build libusb. On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install build-essential libudev-dev`

### Windows

Use [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie//) to install the WinUSB driver for your USB device, Otherwise you will get `LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` when attempting to open devices.
- Install app from [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie//)
- Ensure device is plugged in and run Zadig
- Select options -> list all devices to populate devices
- Select your device and WinUSB driver
- Press the 'Replace Driver' button and wait

### macOS

On macOS (tested on High Sierra and Mojave), installing `ant-plus` will also
install the required `libusb`.

Make sure that Garmin Express is not running,
because it will attach to the ANT+ stick and prevent `ant-plus` from doing so.

## Install

```sh
npm install ant-plus
```

## usage

```javascript
var Ant = require('ant-plus');
```

#### Create USB stick

```javascript
var stick = new Ant.GarminStick3;
```

#### Create sensors

```javascript
var sensor = new Ant.HeartRateSensor(stick);
```

#### Attach events

```javascript
sensor.on('hbData', function (data) {
    console.log(data.DeviceID, data.ComputedHeartRate);
});

stick.on('startup', function () {
    sensor.attach(0, 0);
});
```

#### Open stick

```javascript
if (!stick.open()) {
    console.log('Stick not found!');
}
```

### scanning

```javascript
sensor.on('hbData', function (data) {
    console.log(data.DeviceID, data.ComputedHeartRate);
});

stick.on('startup', function () {
    sensor.scan();
);

if (!stick.open()) {
    console.log('Stick not found!');
}
```

## Important notes

* never attach a sensor before receiving the startup event
* never attach a new sensor before receiving the attached or detached event of the previous sensor
* never detach a sensor before receiving the attached or detached event of the previous sensor

## Objects

### GarminStick2 and GarminStick3

GarminStick2 is the driver for ANT+ sticks with a USB product ID of `0x1008`.
As well as the old Garmin USB2 ANT+ stick, this works with many of the common off-brand clones.

GarminStick3 is the driver for the mini Garmin ANT+ stick
which has a USB product ID of `0x1009`.

#### properties

##### maxChannels

The maximum number of channels that this stick supports; valid only after startup event fired.

#### methods

##### is_present()

Checks if the stick is present. Returns true if it is, false otherwise.

##### open()

Tries to open the stick. Returns false on failure.

##### openAsync(callback)

Tries to open the stick, waiting for it if not available right now. Returns a cancellation token with a method `cancel` you can use to stop waiting.
`callback` is a function accepting a single `Error` parameter and it will be called when the stick is open (with the parameter undefined) or in case of failure (with the parameter set to the error).

##### close()

Closes the stick.

#### events

##### startup

Fired after the stick is correctly initialized.

##### shutdown

Fired after the stick is correctly closed.

### Common to all Sensors

#### methods

##### attach(channel, deviceId)

Attaches the sensors, using the specified channel and deviceId (use 0 to connect to the first device found).

##### detach()

Detaches the sensor.

#### events

##### attached

Fired after the sensor is correctly attached.

##### detached

Fired after the sensor is correctly detached.

### Common to all Scanners

#### methods

##### scan()

Attaches the sensors and starts scanning for data from every devices in range.

##### detach()

Detaches the sensor.

#### events

##### attached

Fired after the sensor is correctly attached.

##### detached

Fired after the sensor is correctly detached.

### HeartRate

#### events

##### hbData

Fired when new heartbeat data is received.

### SpeedCadence

#### methods

#### setWheelCircumference(circumferenceInMeters)

Calibrates the speed sensor. Defaults to a wheel with diameter of 70cm (= 2.199).

#### events

##### speedData

Fired when a new wheel speed is calculated.

##### cadenceData

Fired when a new pedal cadence is calculated.

### StrideSpeedDistance

#### events

##### ssdData

Fired when new data been calculated.

### BicyclePower

#### events

##### powerData

Fired when new power has been calculated.

### FitnessEquipment

#### events

##### fitnessData

Fired when new data is received.

### Environment

#### events

##### envData

Fired when data is received.

The `state.EventCount` value can be used to tell when a new measurement has been made by the sensor -
it's value will have been incremented.
